<section class="intro">
    <h1>Introduction</h1>
    <p>
        I am fairly new to coding and web development.  I have been working on backend and database work for roughly three months for a Utah dev shop.  Much of what I know comes from the Coding Campus, a Utah based coding bootcamp specializing in Python based programming.
    </p>
    <p>
        Prior to my current work, I was a Supply Chain Manager, and have been involved in many facets of supply chain with various manufacturing companies.  I’ve always had a passion for problem solving and the closest thing to coding was creating robust spreadsheets and scenario modeling with macros and formulas on Excel.  I decided to finally take the plunge and do a complete 180 degree career change in February of 2015, and dive right into coding.
    </p>
    <p>
        The experience has been profound and I am constantly evolving in my skill set and the way I think, in terms of code, with each new thing I learn on a daily basis.  The ability to instantly apply concepts and ideas upon discovery is what I love most.  It’s unlike college academics, trying to retain knowledge long enough to take a test, before dumping everything out and never reflecting back on the information again.

    <h1>Where I'm from</h1>
    <p>
        I grew up in Oakland, California, but have lived in various areas around the country, and overseas, since graduating high school.   I currently reside in Orem, Utah.  It is nice place, with easy accessibility to the wide outdoors.  The people here are nice and courteous, and the entrepreneurial technology scene is on a very elevated incline.
    </p>
    <p>
        Out of all the places, I’ve lived, Idaho has always been my favorite.  The nostalgia of a small town at the base of a mountain wilderness really resonates with me.

    <h1>More about me</h1>
    <h3>What are your favorite hobbies?</h3>
    <p>
        I am an avid climber and snowboarder.  I just love the outdoors, in general.  In the summer if I’m not climbing I’m usually running along the Wasatch trails, mountain biking down hills, camping in the Uintas, traversing the narrow canyons of southern Utah, and whatever else I can find to keep me busy.  In the winter, I’m usually riding down the slopes or out on a nice stroll in my snowshoes.
    </p>
    <h3>What's your dream job?</h3>
    <p>
        My dream job is to be a national parks guide, but since that doesn't really pay well, coding while being a guide would be stellar.
    </p>
    <h3>What's your backbround?</h3>
    <p>
        I have a bachelor's in business management from Brigham Young University-Idaho and a Master's in logistics and supply chain management from Embry-Riddle Aeronatuical University.  I learned to code from Coding Campus, which introduced me to Python and the Django framework.
    </p>
    <h3>What music have you been listening to lately?</h3>
    <p>
        I've been listening to a lot of the Nationals, lately.  I don't really have a specific genre, it all just depends on my mood.
